## My process

I started with HTML and organizing the information. I then laid out the columns and container on the page so it is centered and sized appropriately. Then I styled the individual pieces. For layout in desktop view, I started off with flexbox but realized using grid would make sense in this case.

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I am still getting used to being flexible with the designs since it is more optimal to consider responsiveness. I learned that flexbox is not the only way to go for making layouts and that grid works great in different cases. 

### Continued development

I am more comfortable with just writing code now, so I would like to continue practicing and creating pages with more content. I think the components are great practice, but working on larger projects would be helpful in seeing how web development comes together.
