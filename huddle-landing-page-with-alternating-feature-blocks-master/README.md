## My process

This one took a bit of time... However, I felt like I understood how to do what I needed to do. The mobile design was not too hard to code but organizing the HTML so that the desktop design could be made was an important step. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned the difficulties of translating mobile to desktop websites. 

### Continued development

I hope to learn more about best practices for responsive web design instead of just media querying everything.
