## My process

HTML organization first, then general CSS styles such as fonts and colors, then I styled each individual piece to match the design.

### Built with

- HTML/CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am getting used to creating and styling components!

### Continued development

After a few more challenges, I think it will become more necessary to work with em/rem and percentages for responsiveness. I think I haven't been using them as much because I'm trying to match the designs exactly, but next time I should think more about how the component changes when resizing and the overall experience.
