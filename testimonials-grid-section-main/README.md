## My process

For this challenge, since it involved multiple components as opposed to previous challenges, I took it one piece at a time. I focused on the first box, organizing the html, and then styling it. Afterwards, lay out of that same container. I then moved on to the other ones and then finished overall layout after everything was styled.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I took my time on this one to learn and process what I was doing. I practiced more of CSS Grid and saw how powerful it is for layouts.

### Continued development

This was a good start to Junior challenges which the rest are full web pages. I am excited to tackle them on, especially with more comfortability with CSS Grid.
