## My process

Look at the pieces, organize and then style.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about layouts with CSS Grid and web page layouts in general. There is more planning involved compared to just creating individual components. 

### Continued development

With this, I am done with the Newbie exercises on Front End Mentor! I will continue practicing with the HTML/CSS only projects which are all web pages from what I've seen. I am excited!
