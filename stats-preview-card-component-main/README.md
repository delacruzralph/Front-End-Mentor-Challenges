## My process

HTML structure then CSS styling, although I had some difficulties with the layout especially for translating the mobile design into desktop. It took some messing around with and I was able to code something that worked for both views. 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about using padding, margin, and percentages for responsive design. I also got to use flexbox to change the layout responsively.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about good ways to utilize flexbox properly for layouts specifically for responsive design. I feel like for this project, it was a bit messy for me.
